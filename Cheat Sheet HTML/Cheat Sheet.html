<!--This is a comment. Users cant see it, and neither can your browser. This is JUST for you to make notes to yourself throughout your code.-->
<!--Note the syntax for a comment. Less than symbol, exclamation point, dash dash, comment, dash dash, greater than symbol-->

<!--HTML pages are made of content, controlled and displyed differently by ELEMENTS. ELEMENTS are made of TAGS-- the basic building blocks of HTML-->
<!--The SYNTAX of an ELEMENT is: <starttag> content </endtag> -->
<!--The SYNTAX of a TAG is: <tagname> (for start tags) AND </endtag> -->
<!--Tags always occur in pairs, unless they are self-closing tags (AKA "empty elements"). A good example of this is the <br> or "Line break" element tag. -->
<!-- Different elements (made of different tags) display content DIFFERENTLY on our web page. Which is why there are so many!-->
<!--Some elements give the HTML document a structure and shape. Others communicate info to the web browser. Others display ALL the content for us and a user to see on our page. Others display that content differently.-->

<!--It doesnt matter how many times you press "enter" on your keyboard as you write HTML pages. Atom doesnt care, and neither does you web browser.
  You can
  space
  your
  content
  however you like. It will still be read the same way as if it was neatly organized in one line.
  Unless you insert elements or tags designed SPECIFICALLY to insert a line breach or some padding/ space before and after the content they are displaying, the web browser will smash all the content right up against each other on your web page -->
